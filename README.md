# Web Scrapers
## There is two versions, for web apps and for web sites

### Differences between methods
* Web App: You need to wait for the scripts to load in the web page, like an SPA. For this method you need to use "puppeteer".
* Web Site: The content is accessible immediately. For this method you need to use "axios" and "cheerio.js".
